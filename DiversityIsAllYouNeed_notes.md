## Applications of learning skills without rewards
 * If the rewards are sparse there is effectively no reward until the agent randomly reaches a goal. Skills learned without reward can serve as primitives for hierarchical RL, thus making it develop faster.
 * It is free to interact with the surroundings, but it rewards require human interaction. 
 * It is difficult to determine what tasks an agent should learn, unsupervised can provide answers to that.
